LeapMotion-DareToDrum
=====================

A hackathon project (LA Hacks, March 2014) integrating Leap Motion technology -- a DDR-like game where users drum in the air to arrows that show up after the correct drum has been hit. Points accumulate as drummers drum along to music that correlates to the current background.
